Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] UFS1/2 support series

Change since v1:
* Fix bug on dentry structure (thank you specification; btw, sarcasm), and
consequently a bug on ufs_readdir.
* Add readlink support (applied tests for symlinks whose destionation path
were stored in blk pointers and the file itself).
* Several improvements.

Wrote the documentation below. I think it would be good to push the doc to
the wiki as soon as the UFS support gets merged.

Unix Fast File System (UFS/FFS) 1/2 on Syslinux - (usage/install)
-----
There is a confusion about the name of this file system, then I decided to
contact the author, Kirk McKusick, who replied:
"The name has always been confusing (my bad). The code is broken into two
parts, the part that handles naming (UFS where the U stands for Unix), and the
part that handles disk layout (FFS where the F stands for Fast).
When the two parts are put together they are called UFS/FFS or more commonly
just UFS."

Dependencies:
- Environment:
Require a *GNU/Linux* system to follow these steps.
- Package:
ufsutils (UFS filesystems utilities)
- Device driver:
UFS support on Linux: you need a kernel with the option CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE
enabled or at least configured as a module.
For the latter case, load the module ufs.ko with modprobe (probably located
at: /lib/modules/).
If this option wasn't even configured as a module, then you need to recompile
your kernel with that option enabled.
Further information can be found in the link below:

Creating an UFS image:
    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=<image> bs= count=;
    - UFS1:
    sudo mkfs.ufs -O 1 <image>;
    - UFS2:
    sudo mkfs.ufs <image>;

Mounting an UFS image:
    - UFS1:
    sudo mount -t ufs -o rw,loop,ufstype=44bsd <image> <mountpoint>;
    - UFS2:
    sudo mount -t ufs -o rw,loop,ufstype=ufs2 <image> <mountpoint>;

Installing syslinux on an UFS image:
    - Install extlinux into your mount point:
    sudo extlinux -i <mountpoint>;

    - Finally, set up the syslinux config file.


Thanks for pcacjr who introduced me to Syslinux :-)
